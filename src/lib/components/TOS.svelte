Business. DapUp presents this information to eligible Athletes on the platform for Athletes to indicate
whether such Campaign is one they would like to pursue. Each Campaign details a brief description of
the Campaign, deliverables, a start and end date, compensation information, and any exclusivity requirements.
If accepted to the Campaign, participating Athletes will receive additional information and Guidelines

comply with the requirements established by DapUp (referred to as the “Requirements”). By accepting and

must remain intact in order to comply with FTC requirements. <br /><br />

Reporting: The outcomes of all connections between Businesses and Athletes must be reported within 2
days of Athlete receiving compensation by emailing the executed agreements to contracts@dapup.co,

performance of the Services to DapUp; (b) require the disclosure or use of Confidential Information;

exclusivity. DapUp has no obligation to propose a Campaign to Athlete and may receive content services
from other Athletes during the term of this Agreement. DapUp has no obligation of exclusivity to Businesses
and no obligation, and shall face no liability for any failure, to enforce any possible exclusivity obligations
between Athletes and Businesses. <br /><br />

entitled to the compensation in connection with a Campaign. Athletes who do not comply with the Requirements
and this Agreement will not be entitled to the compensation associated with such Campaign. Failure to
submit required posts within the Campaign posting period or to make necessary edits to published posts
in a timely manner may result in disqualification to participate in the Campaign and reduced or non-payment
of associated compensation. <br /><br />
Any non-payment of the Athlete by any Business may result in such Business’ removal from the Platform.
Any material deviation of the Campaign by a Business from the details provided in the post of the Campaign
that the Athlete agreed to must be agreed by the Athlete in writing. If a Business makes material changes
or attempts to make material changes to the Campaign without agreement by the Athlete in writing, DapUp
